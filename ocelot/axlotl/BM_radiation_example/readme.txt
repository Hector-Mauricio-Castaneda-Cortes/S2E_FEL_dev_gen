In this folder examples of bending magnet radiation calculated in SRW and Ocelot are located.
Both calculations were prepared for the PETRA III beam and bending magnet with parameters:
  Length: 5.378 m
  Filed: 0.10439 T
  Radius: 191.73 m
The field was calculated at 14.2 m distance from the source point.
